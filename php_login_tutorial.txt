PHP login tutorial
-------------------

0. Use includes for header and footer, and any other repetitive code

1. Create a table to hold user data
2. Create a user class: atributes, constructor, minimal setter/getter methods
3. From a php script, connect to the database and include the User class

4. Create a form for user login
5. Experiment with submission methods and resulting varibles: POST and GET
   Your form elements need to have a name attribute, which will be the key for the
   POST or GET variables value

6. Retrieve a particular user by login, loading an object from the database
7. Check if the user's password match with the input from the form
8. If the passowrd is correct, set a session variable user_id
9. Print the user_id in other pages, to check if it is properly set

10. Create a logout page that says "Goodbye, user_name"

11. Create a form for user subscription (use the cars demo as a reference)
12. Load a user object and insert it to the database
